CricResult - Using Neural Networks to Predict Match Results

How It Works?
This site uses the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/BrainJS/brain.js" target="blank">brain.js</a> Neural Networks library and past IPL Data (all of it) to predict the match winners.

PREDICTIONS ARE NOT GUARANTEED. WE NEITHER ENCOURAGE GAMBLING NOR DO WE ENCOURAGE THE USE OF THESE PREDICTIONS FOR GAMBLING.
